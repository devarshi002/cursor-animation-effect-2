# Spark Animation

This project creates a spark animation effect on the screen that follows the mouse cursor.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Move your mouse around the screen to see the spark animation follow the cursor.

## Customization

You can customize the spark animation by modifying the following:
- Size and color of the spark in the CSS (`width`, `height`, `background`)
- Duration and easing of the animation in the CSS (`animation`)
- Behavior of the spark (e.g., speed, direction) in the JavaScript (`getRandomTransitionValue` function)

Feel free to experiment and make the spark animation your own!
